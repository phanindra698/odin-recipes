<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is the best meatloaf recipe ever and comes complete with a yummy glaze. It will knock your socks off!</p>
<p>My mom never made meatloaf when I was growing up so when I moved out on my own, I started experimenting with different recipes and this is my best creation.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
    <li>3 slices bread, toasted and crumbled</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook onion and garlic until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Combine onion and garlic mixture, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce in a large bowl. Mix until well combined. Gradually stir in milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until mixture is moist, but not soggy.</li>
    <li>Transfer the mixture to a 5x9-inch loaf pan.</li>
    <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup in a small bowl. Pour over the top of the meatloaf, and continue baking for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
